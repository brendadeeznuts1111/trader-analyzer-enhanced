🚨 BREAKING: I just built the most powerful open-source trading intelligence platform ever released.

It's called "EdgeTerminal" - and it's about to change how traders learn, analyze, and compete.

A thread 🧵👇

1/10 🧠 THE PROBLEM
Most traders fail because they can't see the "edge" in real-time data.

They stare at charts but miss:
- Cross-exchange arbitrage opportunities
- Pattern recognition across markets
- Real-time sentiment analysis
- Competitive positioning

2/10 💡 THE SOLUTION
EdgeTerminal unifies ALL trading data into canonical markets:

• BTC/USD across Binance, BitMEX, Bybit
• US Election odds on Polymarket + Kalishi
• Super Bowl predictions
• Fed rate decisions
• Sports betting markets

Same market, every exchange, real-time.

3/10 🎮 ROLE-PLAY LEARNING
The killer feature: Learn by role-playing top traders.

Watch historical trades, then guess what they'd do next.
Real-time scoring. Pattern recognition training.

It's like chess analysis but for trading.

4/10 🤖 AI PATTERN RECOGNITION
Built-in AI analyzes your trading patterns:

• Risk tolerance assessment
• Trading frequency analysis

5/10 📊 REAL-TIME DASHBOARD
Live data streaming:

6/10 🏆 COMPETITIVE FEATURES
Compare yourself against other traders:

7/10 🛠️ TECH STACK
Built with cutting-edge tech:

• Bun runtime (30x faster than npm)
• Next.js 16 + React 19
• Real-time SSE streams
• TypeScript everywhere
• Fly.io deployment (3-second deploys)

Zero bloat. Pure performance.

8/10 🚀 OPEN SOURCE
Everything is free and open-source:
